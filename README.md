# YoutubeClone

I used Reactjs for the frontend of this app 

The Material UI Library was used to design the user interface

Rapid API Youtube v3 for YouTube data

If you are cloning this application, don't forget to create the .env file in the root folder and then create an environment variable called VITE_REACT_APP_API_KEY and add your API key.
